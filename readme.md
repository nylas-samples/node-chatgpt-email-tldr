This sample will show you to easily use the Nylas Node.js SDK and the OpenAI Node.js SDK to summarize your email messages.

## Setup

### System dependencies

- Node.js v16.x

### Gather environment variables

You'll need the following values:

```text
ACCESS_TOKEN = ""
CLIENT_ID = ""
CLIENT_SECRET = ""
RECIPIENT_ADDRESS = ""
OPENAI_API_KEY = ""
```

Add the above values to a new `.env` file:

```bash
$ touch .env # Then add your env variables
```

### Install dependencies

```bash
$ npm i
```

## Usage

Run the script using the `node` command:

```bash
$ npm start
```

When your messages are successfully summarized, you'll get the following output in your terminal for a few emails:

```text
# date, from, subject, message ID, summary
[4/20/2023] news@address-dot-com - UPCOMING EXHIBITIONS (1234567)
Summary: TEZUKAYAMA GALLERY is holding two upcoming exhibitions from May to June: Hirano Solo Exhibition and Gallery Collection featuring works by Funakoshi. The exhibitions will run from May 12 to June 10, with a reception party on the opening night. The email also includes news about upcoming exhibitions by other artists. The gallery is located in Osaka, Japan.
```

The core of this example is the "summary" in the output above. This is the summary of the email message, generated by the OpenAI API. Email data is fetched from the Nylas API.
